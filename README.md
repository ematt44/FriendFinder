# FriendFinder



This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
